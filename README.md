# Daydream

It's command-line program for figuring out the day.

I did not compile it, you have to do that by yourself.

## Requirements

- [Dart SDK](https://www.dart.dev/get-dart)
- A command-line shell (e.g. Bash, CMD or PowerShell)

## Compilation

Once you have the Dart SDK added to your PATH variable, run this command in your shell:
```powershell
dart compile exe daydream.dart
```
> Note: If you are not on Windows, there are [alternative ways](https://dart.dev/tools/dart-compile).

## Bottom-line

I'm terrible, both as a coder and as an instructor. Forgive me, kind Sir/Ma'm.
